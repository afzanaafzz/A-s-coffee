            <h2>HISTORY OF COFFEE</h2>
            <p id="history">
                Coffee grown worldwide can trace its heritage back centuries to the ancient coffee forests on the
                Ethiopian plateau. There, legend says the goat herder Kaldi first discovered the potential of these
                beloved.
                The story goes that that Kaldi discovered coffee after he noticed that after eating the berries from a
                certain tree, his goats became so energetic that they did not want to sleep at night.
                Kaldi reported his findings to the abbot of the local monastery, who made a drink with the berries and
                found that it kept him alert through the long hours of evening prayer. The abbot shared his discovery
                with the other monks at the monastery, and knowledge of the energizing berries began to spread.
                As word moved east and coffee reached the Arabian peninsula, it began a journey which would bring these
                beans across the globe.Coffee was not only enjoyed in homes, but also in the many public coffee houses —
                called qahveh khaneh — which began to appear in cities across the Near East. The popularity of the
                coffee houses was unequaled and people frequented them for all kinds of social activity.
                Not only did the patrons drink coffee and engage in conversation, but they also listened to music,
                watched performers, played chess and kept current on the news. Coffee houses quickly became such an
                important center for the exchange of information.
